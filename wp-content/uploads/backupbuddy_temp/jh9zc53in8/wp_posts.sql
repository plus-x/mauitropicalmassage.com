The root meaning of yoga is union or joining, in other words to come into <em>union and join</em> with universal divine spirit. Traditionally, the guru or teacher  guides the yoga student along the way, in partner yoga, we become the gurus for each other.\r\n\r\nPartner Yoga is an emerging practice with some aspects of Tantra, like Partner Yoga, tantra is a word with many misconceptions. Tantra is not exclusively about sex and for lovers only, the word Tantra essentially means to weave. Partner Yoga also holds the philosophy of using relationship as a tool for awakening to our true nature and connecting to our higher selves.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"partner-yoga5\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/partner-yoga5-300x180.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" /> The practice of Partner Yoga helps bring our relation patterns into balance. In our partner, we have a mirror, a physical presence that brings us deeper into the present moment and more fully into our infinite selves. Just as in our relationships off the mat, in Partner Yoga we experience directly what it feels like to build trust, compassion, and intimacy with others. Our partners reflect back to us the qualities that we express. This is both the pleasure and the challenge of Partner Yoga, because we are made acutely aware of those moments when we are shut down, distrustful, and unwilling to open and connect.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"partner-yoga4\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/partner-yoga4-300x195.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"195\" />Partner Yoga teaches the fundamental value of joining and sharing with others through way of partner and group asana. In addition, Partner Yoga Bliss uses healing art tools such as, mantra, pranayama, and thai massage. I’d like to emphasize that Partner Yoga is not for lovers only – it can be practiced by any two or more willing participants- friends, acquaintances, siblings, parents and children.', 'Partner Yoga', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'partners-yoga', '', '', '2013-09-23 02:33:24', '2013-09-23 02:33:24', '', '0', '/?page_id=94', '0', 'page', '', '0');

Try one or more of these techniques for 15 minutes once or twice a day.\r\n\r\n<strong>Body Scan:</strong> Starting with your head and working down to your arms and feet, notice how you feel in your body. Taking in your head and neck, simply notice if you feel tense, relaxed, calm or anxious. See how much you can spread any sensations of softness and relaxation to areas of your body that feel tense. Once your reach your feet, work back up your body.   10-15 minutes\r\n\r\n<strong>Breath Focus:</strong> Sit comfortably. Tune into your breath, follow the sensation of inhaling from your nose to abdomen and out again. Let tension go with each exhalation. When you notice your mind wandering, return to your breath.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mantra Repetition:</strong> The relaxation response can be evoked by sitting quietly with eyes closed for 15 minutes twice a day, and mentally repeating a simple word or sound such as \'\'Om\'\' or \"Aum\".\r\n\r\n<strong>Guided Imagery:</strong> Imagine a wonderfully relaxing light or a soothing waterfall washing away tension from your body and mind. Make your image vivid, imagining texture, colour and any fragrance as the image washes over you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Maui_Wellness_Retreat_Meditation1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-195\" alt=\"Maui_Wellness_Retreat_Meditation1\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Maui_Wellness_Retreat_Meditation1.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"224\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>7 Health Benefits of Deep Relaxation</h2>\r\nThe next time you tune out and switch off and let yourself melt, remind yourself of all the good work the relaxation effect is doing on your body. These are just some of the scientifically proven benefits …\r\n\r\n<strong>1. INCREASED IMMUNITY</strong>\r\n\r\nRelaxation appears to boost immunity in recovering cancer patients. A study at the Ohio State University found that progressive muscular relaxation, when practised daily, reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence. In another study at Ohio State, a month of relaxation exercises boosted natural killer cells in the elderly, giving them a greater resistance to tumours and to viruses.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. EMOTIONAL BALANCE</strong>\r\n\r\nEmotional balance, means to be free of all the neurotic behavior that results from the existence of a tortured and traumatized ego. This is very hard to achieve fully, but meditation certainly is the way to cure such neurosis and unhealthy emotional states. As one’s consciousness is cleansed of emotionally soaked memories, not only does great freedom abound, but also great balance. As one’s responses then are not colored by the burdens one carries, but are instead true, direct and appropriate.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. INCREASED FERTILITY</strong>\r\n\r\nA study at the University of Western Australia found that women are more likely to conceive during periods when they are relaxed rather than stressed. A study at Trakya University, in Turkey, also found that stress reduces sperm count and motility, suggesting relaxation may also boost male fertility.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. RELIEVES IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome began practising a relaxation meditation twice daily, their symptoms of bloating, diarrhoea and constipation improved significantly. The meditation was so effective the researchers at the State University of New York recommended it as an effective treatment.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE</strong>\r\n\r\nA study at Harvard Medical School found that meditation lowered blood pressure by making the body less responsive to stress hormones, in a similar way to blood pressure-lowering medication. Meanwhile a British Medical Journal report found that patients trained how to relax had significantly lower blood pressure.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. ANTI-INFLAMATORY</strong>\r\n\r\nStress leads to inflammation, a state linked to heart disease, arthritis, asthma and skin conditions such as psoriasis, say researchers at Emory University in the US. Relaxation can help prevent and treat such symptoms by switching off the stress response. In this way, one study at McGill University in Canada found that meditation clinically improved the symptoms of psoriasis.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. CALMNESS</strong>\r\n\r\nThe simple difference between those who meditate and those who do not, is that for a meditative mind the thought occurs but is witnessed, while for an ordinary mind, the thought occurs and is the boss.

These are just some of the scientifically proven benefits …\n\n<strong>1. INCREASED IMMUNITY</strong>\n\nRelaxation appears to boost immunity in recovering cancer patients. A study at the Ohio State University found that progressive muscular relaxation, when practised daily, reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence. In another study at Ohio State, a month of relaxation exercises boosted natural killer cells in the elderly, giving them a greater resistance to tumours and to viruses.\n\n<strong>2. EMOTIONAL BALANCE</strong>\n\nEmotional balance, means to be free of all the neurotic behavior that results from the existence of a tortured and traumatized ego. This is very hard to achieve fully, but meditation certainly is the way to cure such neurosis and unhealthy emotional states. As one’s consciousness is cleansed of emotionally soaked memories, not only does great freedom abound, but also great balance. As one’s responses then are not colored by the burdens one carries, but are instead true, direct and appropriate.\n\n<strong>3. INCREASED FERTILITY</strong>\n\nA study at the University of Western Australia found that women are more likely to conceive during periods when they are relaxed rather than stressed. A study at Trakya University, in Turkey, also found that stress reduces sperm count and motility, suggesting relaxation may also boost male fertility.\n\n<strong>4. RELIEVES IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME</strong>\n\nWhen patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome began practising a relaxation meditation twice daily, their symptoms of bloating, diarrhoea and constipation improved significantly. The meditation was so effective the researchers at the State University of New York recommended it as an effective treatment.\n\n<strong>5. LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE</strong>\n\nA study at Harvard Medical School found that meditation lowered blood pressure by making the body less responsive to stress hormones, in a similar way to blood pressure-lowering medication. Meanwhile a British Medical Journal report found that patients trained how to relax had significantly lower blood pressure.\n\n<strong>6. ANTI-INFLAMATORY</strong>\n\nStress leads to inflammation, a state linked to heart disease, arthritis, asthma and skin conditions such as psoriasis, say researchers at Emory University in the US. Relaxation can help prevent and treat such symptoms by switching off the stress response. In this way, one study at McGill University in Canada found that meditation clinically improved the symptoms of psoriasis.\n\n<strong>7. CALMNESS</strong>\n\nThe simple difference between those who meditate and those who do not, is that for a meditative mind the thought occurs but is witnessed, while for an ordinary mind, the thought occurs and is the boss. So in both minds, an upsetting thought can occur, but for those who meditate it is just another thought, which is seen as such and is allowed to blossom and die, while in the ordinary mind the thought instigates a storm which rages on and on.\n<h2>Types of Meditation Taught @ Maui Wellness Retreat</h2>\nHow can you use relaxation\'s healing powers? Harvard researchers found that yoga, meditation and even repetitive prayer and mantras all induced the relaxation effect. \'\'The more regularly these techniques are practiced, the more deeply rooted the benefits will be,\'\' Jake Toby says. Try one or more of these techniques for 15 minutes once or twice a day.\n\n<strong>Body Scan:</strong> Starting with your head and working down to your arms and feet, notice how you feel in your body. Taking in your head and neck, simply notice if you feel tense, relaxed, calm or anxious. See how much you can spread any sensations of softness and relaxation to areas of your body that feel tense. Once your reach your feet, work back up your body.   10-15 minutes\n\n<strong>Breath Focus:</strong> Sit comfortably. Tune into your breath, follow the sensation of inhaling from your nose to abdomen and out again. Let tension go with each exhalation. When you notice your mind wandering, return to your breath.\n\n<strong>Mantra Repetition:</strong> The relaxation response can be evoked by sitting quietly with eyes closed for 15 minutes twice a day, and mentally repeating a simple word or sound such as \'\'Om\'\' or \"Aum\".\n\n<strong>Guided Imagery:</strong> Imagine a wonderfully relaxing light or a soothing waterfall washing away tension from your body and mind. Make your image vivid, imagining texture, colour and any fragrance as the image washes over you.\n\nSource: <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/relax--its-good-for-you-20090819-eqlo.html#ixzz1kQtHr9Pm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/relax--its-good-for-you-20090819-eqlo.html#ixzz1kQtHr9Pm</a>', 'Meditation', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '98-autosave-v1', '', '', '2013-10-05 15:10:26', '2013-10-06 01:10:26', '', '98', '/98-autosave-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Morning runs, yoga, acroyoga and acrobatics classes will help create the foundational core work that aerial silks requires. Intermediate aerial students will be taught more advanced techniques.\r\nAerial Silks shares the benefits of traditional yoga such as flexibility, strength and balance while being suspended in the air. Transform yoga into dance! Flying dance! Teachings will focus on climbing techniques, foot locks, hip locks, stalls, drops, and introductory aerial silks poses. Aerial swing techniques will also be covered to assist with inversions and backbends.\r\nMarley Skye from Phoenix Circus, Canada has taught aerial silks and other circus arts to students of all ages for the past eight years. Classes are challenging, fun and made accessible for all levels of physical fitness.\r\nExperience Yoga in the air! Yoga is excellent conditioning for preparing for aerial silks. The added gravity and height of aerial silks assists students in increasing their strength and flexibility at a rapid rate. Students will start with low flying techniques, and gradually progress higher.\r\nStretch and mobilize with a friend! Marley Skye will also be teaching beginner acro yoga classes. Acroyoga is fun, promotes flexibility and employs Thai Massage and gravity to allow deep stretching of muscles, tendons, and bones.\r\n\r\nTypical daily schedule\r\n• 08:00 - 09:00 Group Run, Stretch &amp; Meditation\r\n• 09:00 - 11:00 Aerial Silks with Marley Skye\r\n• 11:00 - 12:00 Fresh and local organic brunch\r\n• 12:00 - 16:00 Free time to explore, get a massage, read through the yoga and spirituality books in the library, relax in the hammocks, swim in waterfalls, etc.\r\n• 16:00 - 18:00 Acro Yoga &amp; Aerial Silks with Marley Skye\r\n• 18:00 - 19:00 Delicious delightful dinner of local and organic goodness\r\n• 19:00 - 21:00 Magical evening activities (different every night)\r\n\r\nInstructor\r\n__________________________<wbr />______________\r\nMarley Skye\r\n\r\nMarley has been studying yoga and athletics since he was a teenager in 1996, and trained in wrestling and track &amp; field under two Olympic level coaches. This early intense training, combined with his passion for arts music and dance propelled him through a unique and self-explorative journey to physical mastery and artistic expression. Marley teaches that each person has a unique path to growth, empowerment and creative expression that needs to be balanced between dreams, personal discipline, play, transformation, creativity and external teaching.\r\n\r\nThe next chapter of Marley’s life was filled with travel and schooling. Marley graduated from University of British Columbia with a bachelors in Asian Languages. A Mandarin major, and a Sanskrit, Tibetan and Hindi Minor led him to deepen his personal practice by combining Chinese acupressure massage techniques and Sanskrit mantras to help awaken and empower the energy body and nerve channels.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marley Skye met dancer and circus aerial acrobat, Freyja and co-founded the Elvolutionaries, an aerial circus performance troupe. Together, they trained and performed aerial circus storytelling shows. Combining circus, theatre, and music the troupe travelled the west coast of North America, and began producing shows for festivals, private and corporate events.\r\nWanting to share this inspiration and empower people with what he had learned, Marley began directing circus classes and retreats in 2009. In that time, Skye has facilitated community classes at recreation centers, Pirate Circus Bootcamps (sailing &amp; circus retreat), Indoor &amp; Outdoor Aerial Circus Retreats, as well as currently running weekly classes for kids and adults.\r\n\r\nSince then, Marley has performed and directed aerial and dance shows at local and international events, including Envision, Symbiosis, Burning Man, Shambala, Diversity Festival, Komasket, Big Time Out, Mystic Island Festival, BassCoast, and numerous other events, as well as community fundraisers, government events, and private events all over the West Coast of British Columbia in the last 8 years.\r\n\r\nIn the past three years, he became the director of Phoenix Circus, as well as the creator and director of “Sweet &amp; Salty Burlesque”, a neo-burlesque permaculture circus &amp; dance troupe.\r\nAn avid learner and multi-talented performer, Marley Skye is inspired by collaboration, innovation and the ability to constantly re-invent ourselves. Marley also teaches firespinning, stiltwalking, juggling, hand balancing, aerial pole, aerial hoop, and costume making, and is a vast resource for learning the circus arts.\r\nMarley Skye brings the passion and devotion of an multi-talented independent artist focused on inspiring others with circus arts to fly through the skies towards their dreams.\r\n\r\nFreyja’s Skye\r\n\r\nOriginally from Germany, Freyja Skye moved to Montreal in 2004 to pursue studies in Contemporary dance. Journeying to the west coast in the summer introduced her to the festival culture and the rich circus arts scene, which inspired her to learn aerial arts – first silks, then Lyra, pole and most recently Spanish Web. After a couple of years in the dance program at Concordia University and another year at Main Dance in Vancouver, she literally ran away with the circus and joined MythMaker on tour for a season. This inspired her to get her own, veggie-oil powered circus bus, and upon meeting Marley Skye in 2007, ‘The Elvolutionaries’ circus troupe was born, travelling across BC and beyond to perform and teach aerial acrobatics and dance at countless music festivals, private and corporate events until the present day.\r\nAs a performer, Freyja embodies wild power and sensual grace.\r\n‘It is important to remember what our role is as performers. We are here to inspire, to reflect back what we receive from the audience, to show them that it is possible to pursue our wildest dreams and reach our full potential!’\r\n\r\nA passionate contact dancer, Freyja has also been teaching contact improvisation for years, now blending it with acrobatics, acro yoga and circus.\r\nFreyja’s biggest inspiration in teaching is: ‘I love to make people fly! It is so empowering to defy gravity, push beyond what we thought our limits were, and it is so rewarding for me to see my students get upside down, feel weightless, and discover their own power!’', 'RETREATS', '', 'private', 'open', 'open', '', 'retreats', '', '', '2016-09-10 20:45:07', '2016-09-11 06:45:07', '', '0', 'http://mauitropicalmassage.com/?page_id=352', '0', 'page', '', '0');

Try one or more of these techniques for 15 minutes once or twice a day.\r\n\r\n<strong>Body Scan:</strong> Starting with your head and working down to your arms and feet, notice how you feel in your body. Taking in your head and neck, simply notice if you feel tense, relaxed, calm or anxious. See how much you can spread any sensations of softness and relaxation to areas of your body that feel tense. Once your reach your feet, work back up your body.   10-15 minutes\r\n\r\n<strong>Breath Focus:</strong> Sit comfortably. Tune into your breath, follow the sensation of inhaling from your nose to abdomen and out again. Let tension go with each exhalation. When you notice your mind wandering, return to your breath.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mantra Repetition:</strong> The relaxation response can be evoked by sitting quietly with eyes closed for 15 minutes twice a day, and mentally repeating a simple word or sound such as \'\'Om\'\' or \"Aum\".\r\n\r\n<strong>Guided Imagery:</strong> Imagine a wonderfully relaxing light or a soothing waterfall washing away tension from your body and mind. Make your image vivid, imagining texture, colour and any fragrance as the image washes over you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Maui_Wellness_Retreat_Meditation1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-195\" alt=\"Maui_Wellness_Retreat_Meditation1\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Maui_Wellness_Retreat_Meditation1.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"224\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>7 Health Benefits of Deep Relaxation</h2>\r\nThe next time you tune out and switch off and let yourself melt, remind yourself of all the good work the relaxation effect is doing on your body. These are just some of the scientifically proven benefits …\r\n\r\n<strong>1. INCREASED IMMUNITY</strong>\r\n\r\nRelaxation appears to boost immunity in recovering cancer patients. A study at the Ohio State University found that progressive muscular relaxation, when practised daily, reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence. In another study at Ohio State, a month of relaxation exercises boosted natural killer cells in the elderly, giving them a greater resistance to tumours and to viruses.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. EMOTIONAL BALANCE</strong>\r\n\r\nEmotional balance, means to be free of all the neurotic behavior that results from the existence of a tortured and traumatized ego. This is very hard to achieve fully, but meditation certainly is the way to cure such neurosis and unhealthy emotional states. As one’s consciousness is cleansed of emotionally soaked memories, not only does great freedom abound, but also great balance. As one’s responses then are not colored by the burdens one carries, but are instead true, direct and appropriate.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. INCREASED FERTILITY</strong>\r\n\r\nA study at the University of Western Australia found that women are more likely to conceive during periods when they are relaxed rather than stressed. A study at Trakya University, in Turkey, also found that stress reduces sperm count and motility, suggesting relaxation may also boost male fertility.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. RELIEVES IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome began practising a relaxation meditation twice daily, their symptoms of bloating, diarrhoea and constipation improved significantly. The meditation was so effective the researchers at the State University of New York recommended it as an effective treatment.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE</strong>\r\n\r\nA study at Harvard Medical School found that meditation lowered blood pressure by making the body less responsive to stress hormones, in a similar way to blood pressure-lowering medication. Meanwhile a British Medical Journal report found that patients trained how to relax had significantly lower blood pressure.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. ANTI-INFLAMATORY</strong>\r\n\r\nStress leads to inflammation, a state linked to heart disease, arthritis, asthma and skin conditions such as psoriasis, say researchers at Emory University in the US. Relaxation can help prevent and treat such symptoms by switching off the stress response. In this way, one study at McGill University in Canada found that meditation clinically improved the symptoms of psoriasis.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. CALMNESS</strong>\r\n\r\nThe simple difference between those who meditate and those who do not, is that for a meditative mind the thought occurs but is witnessed, while for an ordinary mind, the thought occurs and is the boss. So in both minds, an upsetting thought can occur, but for those who meditate it is just another thought, which is seen as such and is allowed to blossom and die, while in the ordinary mind the thought instigates a storm which rages on and on.\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/relax--its-good-for-you-20090819-eqlo.html#ixzz1kQtHr9Pm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/relax--its-good-for-you-20090819-eqlo.html#ixzz1kQtHr9Pm</a>', 'Meditation', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '98-revision-v1', '', '', '2013-10-17 17:29:25', '2013-10-18 03:29:25', '', '98', '/98-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

This early intense training, combined with his passion for arts music and dance propelled him through a unique and self-explorative journey to physical mastery and artistic expression. Marley teaches that each person has a unique path to growth, empowerment and creative expression that needs to be balanced between dreams, personal discipline, play, transformation, creativity and external teaching.\n\nThe next chapter of Marley’s life was filled with travel and schooling. Marley graduated from University of British Columbia with a bachelors in Asian Languages. A Mandarin major, and a Sanskrit, Tibetan and Hindi Minor led him to deepen his personal practice by combining Chinese acupressure massage techniques and Sanskrit mantras to help awaken and empower the energy body and nerve channels.\n\nIn 2007, Marley Skye met dancer and circus aerial acrobat, Freyja and co-founded the Elvolutionaries, an aerial circus performance troupe. Together, they trained and performed aerial circus storytelling shows. Combining circus, theatre, and music the troupe travelled the west coast of North America, and began producing shows for festivals, private and corporate events.\nWanting to share this inspiration and empower people with what he had learned, Marley began directing circus classes and retreats in 2009. In that time, Skye has facilitated community classes at recreation centers, Pirate Circus Bootcamps (sailing &amp; circus retreat), Indoor &amp; Outdoor Aerial Circus Retreats, as well as currently running weekly classes for kids and adults.\n\nSince then, Marley has performed and directed aerial and dance shows at local and international events, including Envision, Symbiosis, Burning Man, Shambala, Diversity Festival, Komasket, Big Time Out, Mystic Island Festival, BassCoast, and numerous other events, as well as community fundraisers, government events, and private events all over the West Coast of British Columbia in the last 8 years.\n\nIn the past three years, he became the director of Phoenix Circus, as well as the creator and director of “Sweet &amp; Salty Burlesque”, a neo-burlesque permaculture circus &amp; dance troupe.\nAn avid learner and multi-talented performer, Marley Skye is inspired by collaboration, innovation and the ability to constantly re-invent ourselves. Marley also teaches firespinning, stiltwalking, juggling, hand balancing, aerial pole, aerial hoop, and costume making, and is a vast resource for learning the circus arts.\nMarley Skye brings the passion and devotion of an multi-talented independent artist focused on inspiring others with circus arts to fly through the skies towards their dreams.\n\nFreyja’s Skye\n\nOriginally from Germany, Freyja Skye moved to Montreal in 2004 to pursue studies in Contemporary dance. Journeying to the west coast in the summer introduced her to the festival culture and the rich circus arts scene, which inspired her to learn aerial arts – first silks, then Lyra, pole and most recently Spanish Web. After a couple of years in the dance program at Concordia University and another year at Main Dance in Vancouver, she literally ran away with the circus and joined MythMaker on tour for a season. This inspired her to get her own, veggie-oil powered circus bus, and upon meeting Marley Skye in 2007, ‘The Elvolutionaries’ circus troupe was born, travelling across BC and beyond to perform and teach aerial acrobatics and dance at countless music festivals, private and corporate events until the present day.\nAs a performer, Freyja embodies wild power and sensual grace.\n‘It is important to remember what our role is as performers. We are here to inspire, to reflect back what we receive from the audience, to show them that it is possible to pursue our wildest dreams and reach our full potential!’\n\nA passionate contact dancer, Freyja has also been teaching contact improvisation for years, now blending it with acrobatics, acro yoga and circus.\nFreyja’s biggest inspiration in teaching is: ‘I love to make people fly! It is so empowering to defy gravity, push beyond what we thought our limits were, and it is so rewarding for me to see my students get upside down, feel weightless, and discover their own power!’', 'RETREATS', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '352-autosave-v1', '', '', '2016-02-21 11:04:11', '2016-02-21 21:04:11', '', '352', 'http://mauitropicalmassage.com/352-autosave-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

Transform yoga into dance! Flying dance! Teachings will focus on climbing techniques, foot locks, hip locks, stalls, drops, and introductory aerial silks poses. Aerial swing techniques will also be covered to assist with inversions and backbends.\r\nMarley Skye from Phoenix Circus, Canada has taught aerial silks and other circus arts to students of all ages for the past eight years. Classes are challenging, fun and made accessible for all levels of physical fitness.\r\nExperience Yoga in the air! Yoga is excellent conditioning for preparing for aerial silks.

This early intense training, combined with his passion for arts music and dance propelled him through a unique and self-explorative journey to physical mastery and artistic expression. Marley teaches that each person has a unique path to growth, empowerment and creative expression that needs to be balanced between dreams, personal discipline, play, transformation, creativity and external teaching.\r\n\r\nThe next chapter of Marley’s life was filled with travel and schooling. Marley graduated from University of British Columbia with a bachelors in Asian Languages. A Mandarin major, and a Sanskrit, Tibetan and Hindi Minor led him to deepen his personal practice by combining Chinese acupressure massage techniques and Sanskrit mantras to help awaken and empower the energy body and nerve channels.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marley Skye met dancer and circus aerial acrobat, Freyja and co-founded the Elvolutionaries, an aerial circus performance troupe. Together, they trained and performed aerial circus storytelling shows. Combining circus, theatre, and music the troupe travelled the west coast of North America, and began producing shows for festivals, private and corporate events.\r\nWanting to share this inspiration and empower people with what he had learned, Marley began directing circus classes and retreats in 2009. In that time, Skye has facilitated community classes at recreation centers, Pirate Circus Bootcamps (sailing &amp; circus retreat), Indoor &amp; Outdoor Aerial Circus Retreats, as well as currently running weekly classes for kids and adults.\r\n\r\nSince then, Marley has performed and directed aerial and dance shows at local and international events, including Envision, Symbiosis, Burning Man, Shambala, Diversity Festival, Komasket, Big Time Out, Mystic Island Festival, BassCoast, and numerous other events, as well as community fundraisers, government events, and private events all over the West Coast of British Columbia in the last 8 years.\r\n\r\nIn the past three years, he became the director of Phoenix Circus, as well as the creator and director of “Sweet &amp; Salty Burlesque”, a neo-burlesque permaculture circus &amp; dance troupe.\r\nAn avid learner and multi-talented performer, Marley Skye is inspired by collaboration, innovation and the ability to constantly re-invent ourselves. Marley also teaches firespinning, stiltwalking, juggling, hand balancing, aerial pole, aerial hoop, and costume making, and is a vast resource for learning the circus arts.\r\nMarley Skye brings the passion and devotion of an multi-talented independent artist focused on inspiring others with circus arts to fly through the skies towards their dreams.\r\n\r\nFreyja’s Skye\r\n\r\nOriginally from Germany, Freyja Skye moved to Montreal in 2004 to pursue studies in Contemporary dance. Journeying to the west coast in the summer introduced her to the festival culture and the rich circus arts scene, which inspired her to learn aerial arts – first silks, then Lyra, pole and most recently Spanish Web. After a couple of years in the dance program at Concordia University and another year at Main Dance in Vancouver, she literally ran away with the circus and joined MythMaker on tour for a season. This inspired her to get her own, veggie-oil powered circus bus, and upon meeting Marley Skye in 2007, ‘The Elvolutionaries’ circus troupe was born, travelling across BC and beyond to perform and teach aerial acrobatics and dance at countless music festivals, private and corporate events until the present day.\r\nAs a performer, Freyja embodies wild power and sensual grace.\r\n‘It is important to remember what our role is as performers. We are here to inspire, to reflect back what we receive from the audience, to show them that it is possible to pursue our wildest dreams and reach our full potential!’\r\n\r\nA passionate contact dancer, Freyja has also been teaching contact improvisation for years, now blending it with acrobatics, acro yoga and circus.\r\nFreyja’s biggest inspiration in teaching is: ‘I love to make people fly! It is so empowering to defy gravity, push beyond what we thought our limits were, and it is so rewarding for me to see my students get upside down, feel weightless, and discover their own power!’', 'RETREATS', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '352-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-02-21 11:04:58', '2016-02-21 21:04:58', '', '352', 'http://mauitropicalmassage.com/352-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

This early intense training, combined with his passion for arts music and dance propelled him through a unique and self-explorative journey to physical mastery and artistic expression. Marley teaches that each person has a unique path to growth, empowerment and creative expression that needs to be balanced between dreams, personal discipline, play, transformation, creativity and external teaching.\r\n\r\nThe next chapter of Marley’s life was filled with travel and schooling. Marley graduated from University of British Columbia with a bachelors in Asian Languages. A Mandarin major, and a Sanskrit, Tibetan and Hindi Minor led him to deepen his personal practice by combining Chinese acupressure massage techniques and Sanskrit mantras to help awaken and empower the energy body and nerve channels.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Marley Skye met dancer and circus aerial acrobat, Freyja and co-founded the Elvolutionaries, an aerial circus performance troupe. Together, they trained and performed aerial circus storytelling shows. Combining circus, theatre, and music the troupe travelled the west coast of North America, and began producing shows for festivals, private and corporate events.\r\nWanting to share this inspiration and empower people with what he had learned, Marley began directing circus classes and retreats in 2009. In that time, Skye has facilitated community classes at recreation centers, Pirate Circus Bootcamps (sailing &amp; circus retreat), Indoor &amp; Outdoor Aerial Circus Retreats, as well as currently running weekly classes for kids and adults.\r\n\r\nSince then, Marley has performed and directed aerial and dance shows at local and international events, including Envision, Symbiosis, Burning Man, Shambala, Diversity Festival, Komasket, Big Time Out, Mystic Island Festival, BassCoast, and numerous other events, as well as community fundraisers, government events, and private events all over the West Coast of British Columbia in the last 8 years.\r\n\r\nIn the past three years, he became the director of Phoenix Circus, as well as the creator and director of “Sweet &amp; Salty Burlesque”, a neo-burlesque permaculture circus &amp; dance troupe.\r\nAn avid learner and multi-talented performer, Marley Skye is inspired by collaboration, innovation and the ability to constantly re-invent ourselves. Marley also teaches firespinning, stiltwalking, juggling, hand balancing, aerial pole, aerial hoop, and costume making, and is a vast resource for learning the circus arts.\r\nMarley Skye brings the passion and devotion of an multi-talented independent artist focused on inspiring others with circus arts to fly through the skies towards their dreams.\r\n\r\nFreyja’s Skye\r\n\r\nOriginally from Germany, Freyja Skye moved to Montreal in 2004 to pursue studies in Contemporary dance. Journeying to the west coast in the summer introduced her to the festival culture and the rich circus arts scene, which inspired her to learn aerial arts – first silks, then Lyra, pole and most recently Spanish Web. After a couple of years in the dance program at Concordia University and another year at Main Dance in Vancouver, she literally ran away with the circus and joined MythMaker on tour for a season. This inspired her to get her own, veggie-oil powered circus bus, and upon meeting Marley Skye in 2007, ‘The Elvolutionaries’ circus troupe was born, travelling across BC and beyond to perform and teach aerial acrobatics and dance at countless music festivals, private and corporate events until the present day.\r\nAs a performer, Freyja embodies wild power and sensual grace.\r\n‘It is important to remember what our role is as performers. We are here to inspire, to reflect back what we receive from the audience, to show them that it is possible to pursue our wildest dreams and reach our full potential!’\r\n\r\nA passionate contact dancer, Freyja has also been teaching contact improvisation for years, now blending it with acrobatics, acro yoga and circus.\r\nFreyja’s biggest inspiration in teaching is: ‘I love to make people fly! It is so empowering to defy gravity, push beyond what we thought our limits were, and it is so rewarding for me to see my students get upside down, feel weightless, and discover their own power!’</span>', 'RETREATS', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '352-revision-v1', '', '', '2016-01-27 22:03:18', '2016-01-28 08:03:18', '', '352', 'http://mauitropicalmassage.com/352-revision-v1/', '0', 'revision', '', '0');
