My name is Micha'ela Hori and I work for a local yoga studio, Wasatch Ayurveda & Yoga Upstairs, in Salt Lake City, UT. We are currently planning our 2016 Fall retreat to Maui and are hoping to connect with a few of the studios located on the island. We offer consultations and seminars in Ayurveda, Vedic Astrology (Jyotish), and Kalari martial arts and would love to open up opportunities for us to come share at different studios.

Our retreat runs September 18-26, 2016. Camp Olowalu will be providing our accommodations, and will serve as our main location during our time in Maui. Myself, and two other teachers will be traveling out to Maui on the 14th with the hopes of doing programs with local studios who are interested in hosting Ayurvedic/Jyotish/Kalari seminars or workshops with us. We would also love to open the doors to any local students who would be interested in joining us on our retreat, day passes are available. Of course, we will work out cost/pricing through your studio and follow your wishes regarding these things. 

Please let me know your thoughts! I am hoping that we can make something work and share our love of healing with the beautiful people of Maui. I can send you PDF files with more information about our practitioner and our retreat once you've replied. 

Mahalo,
Micha'ela Hori "
