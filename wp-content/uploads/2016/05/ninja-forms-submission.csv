I was especially impressed with the About section and reading all of the experiences you all have had. I'm writing because I am planning to come to Maui for about two or three months this summer to participate in a work trade program. I will be staying in Lahaina at a hostel but have been searching for nearby yoga and meditation centers so I can continue my current practice during my travels. I see a few yoga studios but what I'm really looking for is a combination of both, specifically meditation or any sort of spiritual healing center. I'm going through a hard time in my life right now and I believe mediation and exploring my spiritual being is the best path of healing for me at this time and I would really love to incorporate this healing with my travels so that I can get on a good path in my life again. I see that the Maui Wellness Center is a bit far from Lahaina unfortunately, although I definitely plan on visiting at least once during my stay. I was wondering, however, if there were any other options you could recommend for me a little closer to Lahaina? I'd like to have a daily practice during my stay. Any help or recommendations at all would be so appreciated! Have a great day!

Mahalo,
Ellie"
