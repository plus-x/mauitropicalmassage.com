I am a recent graduate from the University of California San Diego. I got my B.S. in Cognitive Science specializing in the clinical aspects of cognition. I have been dancing for over a decade. I began studying contemporary and ecstatic dance at my university and through various workshops. During my studies, I found the topics of embodied cognition through dance and alternative therapy approaches to be incredibly fascinating. I was a research assistant in the cognitive neuroscience lab at my university for over 1 year. The study I worked on in the lab was about utilizing diaphragmatic breathing as an alternative therapy treatment for autistic youth. I truly enjoyed teaching the participants how to do diaphragmatic breathing and working with them throughout the course of the study. 

I moved to Maui recently and am looking for rewarding employment opportunities that utilize my knowledge and natural talents. I would love to discuss with you all ways in which I could be of service to your endeavors here in Maui. Maui Wellness Center is the type of business I would love to get involved with and learn from. 

Mahalo,
Daniell"
