My name is Ann Maxwell. I will be coming to Maui in March for two unique workshop at BodyAlive. I see you have a studio on Maui and I would love to offer a discounted price to the first or both of the intensives I am bringing to Maui. Please see information below. Also, I would be happy to have a skype or phone call if you are curious and want to learn more. 

Here is the Promo code for you or any of your staff to join us! This code will reduce tuition by $50 for first intensive or by $100 for both intensives.

coupon code = maui20	

If any of your staff are PT, OT's, massage therapist or yoga Therapist, they will love the methodology of SomaYoga or if you/they want to increase private session offerings.This work is brain work, after learning,one can re-set their nervous system connection to muscles in as few as 3 conscious practices and this can improve athletic performance and lift yoga plateaus!!
 
 
Body Alive Studio to Host Yoga North's Visionary
SomaYoga & Clinical Intensive
 
 
Body Alive Studio is teaming up with Yoga North International SomaYoga Institute (ISYI) of Duluth, MN offering SomaYoga Therapy and Somatics Intensive & Clinical Techniques in Wailuku Hawaii.
 
 
SomaYoga combines Thomas Hanna's Somatics movement exercises with traditional yoga postures to create a revolutionary practice. It retrains our nervous systems and muscles, allowing us to find increased mobility in our bodies and giving us newfound freedom where before there was restricted movement and possibly pain.
 
 
In 2014 Yoga North became one of the first 12 programs internationally to be accredited into the International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT). Yoga North co-owners Ann Maxwell and Molly McManus will be presenting at this summer's Symposium on Yoga Therapy and Research (SYTAR).
 
 
Yoga North ISYI has provided diverse yoga programming and training for people of all ages since 1995.  Their professional trainings draw students internationally for their groundbreaking methodology. These two intensives will cover how to blend the ancient tradition of yoga with Somatics, which is compatible with recent neuroscience re-education. The Clinical portion of these two intensives will help body work practitioners learn how to integrate SomaYoga into their practice and private sessions.
 
 
Details on SomaYoga Therapy Intensive:
 
SomaYoga Therapy is a unique blend of somatics, classic and therapeutic yoga, which allows students and teachers to safely increase strength, flexibility, and balance.
 
SomaYoga provides simple, lifelong tools to age with grace and ease.
 
·         Learn how to have smarter muscles, rather than working harder.
·         Learn what sensory motor amnesia is, how it develops in the brain and can be reversed.
·         Explore how movement involves the brain, muscles and nervous system and how this knowledge can improve somatic awareness and sensory motor control.
·         Learn how SomaYoga Therapy can help improve posture, relieve chronic pain and improve athletic performance.
·         Learn how to recognize and assess basic imbalances and compensations in others and yourself, and how to bring functional movement back into the body.
 
 
This intensive is perfect for the curious yoga student from beginners to advanced. You will deepen your practice and break through plateaus in your practice. Bodyworkers, healers, PT's OT's, Chiropractors and massage Therapists will add a Somatic dimension to their professional skills, which will improve client outcomes.
 
 
Details on Clinical Intensive:
 
Learn how to work clinically with SomaYoga Methodology!
 
 
This course will support you to become a very effective private session teacher. At Yoga North ISYI we have found it extremely valuable to work with yoga students & pain clients one on one. In private sessions the student gets their own unique needs met and a tailored home practice.
 
 
This workshop will cover how to use SomaYoga for the trunk & core, the pelvis to lower extremities and the shoulder to neck region. We will work with anatomy, functional movement and use the practice of ""Pandiculation"" from somatics to help re-educate the muscles. This re-education followed by a tailored home practice will help the student move with less pain, more ease and grace. Please join us for this powerful self-healing practice!
