We would be interested in setting up a yoga/massage tour to any or all of our destinations. We would work with you by flying your yoga guru at our expense to Bali or Palau if we can put together a group of 10 paying participants.

Costs depend on location and duration and any extra activities.

Let's talk!

Please call Uncle Tom at his office in Honolulu for a reference!
